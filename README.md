Hi everyone, my name is mahamud Hassan I live in South Seattle, originally moved from kenya . I had different jobs but now ready to learn coding.


## Growth Mindset
To me, my growth mindset in learning software development is believing that my coding skills can grow through practice and dedication. It's about tackling coding challenges as opportunities to learn and enhance my abilities. With a growth mindset, I'm open to trying new approaches, learning from mistakes, and consistently improving my software development skills. This mindset empowers me to become a more confident and capable developer.
