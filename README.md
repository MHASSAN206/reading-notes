## Growth Mindset
To me, my growth mindset in learning software development is believing that my coding skills can grow through practice and dedication. It's about tackling coding challenges as opportunities to learn and enhance my abilities. With a growth mindset, I'm open to trying new approaches, learning from mistakes, and consistently improving my software development skills. This mindset empowers me to become a more confident and capable developer.

## Reminders to keep myself in Growth Mindset

* you still have a time Learn and practice.
- practice, Get feedback and comment and fix the issue .
+ If they can do you can do it.
